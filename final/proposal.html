<li>The basic “material point method” simulation in Stomakhin et al. We should be able to do some basic snow simulation, such as throwing a snowball onto a wall.</li>
<li>If time permits (which is likely), we will try to implement the SPH solver as stressed in Gissler et al. We won’t bother with much non-mechanics aspects nonetheless (we will not implement much thermology-related simulation, like baking bunnies in the demo).</li>
<li>If time permits, we will implement more realisistic clumping and compression of snow on our own. Demo for Gissler et al. looks more like sugar powder because of no clumping (as stressed out in YT comment); another example would be like in demos of both Stomakhin et al. and Gissler et al. paper, where the winter service vehicle shovels snow on the street perfectly - in reality a small portion of the snow should clump and stick to the ground.</li>
<li>If time permits (which is very unlikely), we will try to move the simulation pipeline onto CUDA to speed up simulation.</li>
