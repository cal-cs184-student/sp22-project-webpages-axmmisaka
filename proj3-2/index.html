<h1 id="report-on-cs-184-project-3-path-tracer-take-two">Report on CS
184 Project 3: Path Tracer, take two</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This project implements additional features on the basis of previous
project p3-1: pathtracer. For the project requirement, we implemented
part 1 and part 2.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-mirror-and-glass-materials">Part 1: Mirror and Glass
Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Show a sequence of six images of scene <code>CBspheres.dae</code>
rendered with <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4
samples per light.<br />
Using <code>-s 256 -l 16 -r 1920 1080</code>: </br> |
<code>max_ray_depth</code> | Result | |—————–|———————————-| | 0 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_0.png" /> | | 1 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_1.png" /> | | 2 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_2.png" /> | | 3 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_3.png" /> | | 4 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_4.png" /> | | 5 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_5.png" /> | | 100 | <img
src="images/p1/spheres_m_100.png" /> |</p></li>
<li><p>Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that
appear.<br />
We can see a progressive change with the rising
<code>max_ray_depth</code>: at 0 bounce, we can only see the direct
light from light source; at 1 bounce, we can additionally see all direct
reflection from all surfaces and highlights on spheres; at 2 bounces,
secondary reflection of its surrounding begins to appear on the metallic
sphere, and the glass sphere starts to reflect light (however, refract
light doesn’t escape the sphere, so the sphere is significantly dimmer),
also the ceiling is now lit; at 3 bounces, the glass sphere becomes more
transparent and now has proper refraction effects, and we can see the
refracted light in its shadow; at 4 bounces, the glass sphere clears up
more, and a projection of rays appears on the blue wall (rays get
reflected from metallic sphere into the glass sphere, and refracted
towards the wall), also note that the glass sphere reflection on the
metallic sphere starts clearing up as well (with 1 depth delay); 5
bounces and 100 bounces only provides slight visual quality improvements
comparing with previous images.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="part-2-microfacet-material">Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Show a sequence of 4 images of scene
<code>CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae</code> rendered with α set to 0.005,
0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples
per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at
least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that,
to change the α, just open the .dae file and search for
<code>microfacet</code>.<br />
Using <code>-s 512 -l 8 -m 8 -r 1920 1080</code>: </br> | α | Result |
|——-|————————————–| | 0.005 | <img
src="images/p2/dragon_alpha_005.png" /> | | 0.05 | <img
src="images/p2/dragon_alpha_05.png" /> | | 0.25 | <img
src="images/p2/dragon_alpha_25.png" /> | | 0.5 | <img
src="images/p2/dragon_alpha_5.png" /> |</br></p>
<p>As we can see in the images shown above, with higher α values, the
material becomes less reflective and diffuses more.</p></li>
<li><p>Show two images of scene <code>CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae</code>
rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance
sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and
1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly
discuss their difference.<br />
| Cosine Hemisphere Sampling | Importance Sampling |
|———————————-|————————————-| | <img src="images/p2/bunny_cosine.png" />
| <img src="images/p2/bunny_importance.png" /> |</br></p>
<p>As we can see, the importance sampling result is significantly less
noisy, because the default hemisphere sampling has a higher chance to
sample a direction with a low density of microfacets.</p></li>
<li><p>Show at least one image with some other conductor material,
replacing <code>eta</code> and <code>k</code>. Note that you should look
up values for real data rather than modifying them arbitrarily. Tell us
what kind of material your parameters correspond to.<br />

<h2 id="part-3-environment-light-if-implemented---pick-one-exr">Part 3:
Environment Light (if implemented) - pick one exr</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In a few sentences, explain the ideas behind environment lighting
(i.e. why we do it/how it works).<br />
<text></p></li>
<li><p>Show the <code>probability_debug.png</code> file for the .exr
file you are using, generated using the
<code>save_probability_debug()</code> helper function after initializing
your probability distributions.<br />
<text></p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>bunny_unlit.dae</code> scene and your environment
map .exr file and render two pictures, one with uniform sampling and one
with importance sampling. Use 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per
light in each. Compare noise levels.<br />
<text></p></li>
<li><p>Use a different image (if you did part 2, we recommend
<code>bunny_microfacet_cu_unlit.dae</code>) and your environment map
.exr file and render two pictures, one with uniform sampling and one
with importance sampling. Use 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per
light in each. Compare noise levels.<br />

camera model and a thin-lens camera model.<br />
<text></p></li>
<li><p>Show a “focus stack” where you focus at 4 visibly different
depths through a scene.<br />

<li><p>Show a sequence of 4 pictures with visibly different aperture
sizes, all focused at the same point in a scene.<br />
